# Notes for reviewers
- I couldn't find time to do the test during the weekend, so decided to do it after a long day at work, on 24 Apr 2024 18:00.
- During the setuo of the project, I encoutred some issues (lint, test scripts) that affected the development and time needed to finish the test.
- I took lots of time during the test to solve these issues but couldn't so it affected the deliverables.
- lint: configuration file name was ". eslintrc" with an extra space that I couldn't see on VScode during the test.
- tests: Module Map was missing from jes config.
- You can see some extra packages/config in package.json, since I was trying the fix these issues by some workaround (Not knowing the real cause of the problem)


# TO DO
  Before starting the test, I put a plan in order to make sure I add as much as I can of features. Due to the problems listed above, I didn't have time to do so.
  My plan included:
  - Adding logs (wisdom: save locally OR sentry: save online)
  - Adding more unit tests to cover the code and add more scenarios to cover specially negative cases.
  - Writing a proper documentation in the readme file.
  - Enhancing the inline documentation.


# Thank You
regardless of the outcome of the test, I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity. The test was interresting and unique, I enjoyed coding it.
