To run the code: npm run start
To run the test: npm run test

- I wanted to add the unit tests for all rules/functions, and cover more scenarios.
- The readme.md file should've been a proper documentation.
- I wanted to add logging services using sentry

PS: I didn't manage my time correctly so i couldn't finish all the tests and documentations

Thank you
